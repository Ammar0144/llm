# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Security is important, even in educational projects. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us address it responsibly.

### 🚨 Please DO NOT:
- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Share vulnerability details publicly before they're fixed
- Exploit vulnerabilities maliciously

### ✅ Please DO:
1. **Report privately** via email (not public issues)
2. Provide detailed information:
   - Clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact and severity
   - Your suggested fix (if you have one)
3. Give us reasonable time to fix before any public disclosure
4. Help us test the fix if needed

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🔐 Security Features

This project includes:
- ✅ IP-based access control (configurable)
- ✅ Internal-only LLM endpoints (production mode)
- ✅ Public health check endpoint for monitoring
- ✅ Request logging for audit trails
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Docker containerization

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (By Design)

This is a **learning project** with intentional limitations:

### Model Limitations:
- Small model (DistilGPT-2 82M parameters)
- No content filtering or safety checks
- No authentication/authorization built-in
- Basic rate limiting (not production-grade)
- Designed for low-resource environments

### Security Considerations:
- ⚠️ **Not production-ready** out of the box
- ⚠️ Requires additional hardening for production use
- ⚠️ No user authentication included
- ⚠️ Basic access control only
- ⚠️ Designed for internal/learning environments

## 🔐 Deployment Security

### For Learning/Development:
- ✅ Use in isolated development environments
- ✅ Don't expose to public internet without additional security
- ✅ Keep dependencies updated: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`
- ✅ Review and understand the code
- ✅ Use environment variables for configuration

### For Production (Not Recommended Without Hardening):
If you must deploy to production, add:
- 🔐 Authentication and authorization
- 🔒 HTTPS/TLS encryption
- 🛡️ Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- 📊 Security monitoring and alerting
- 🔍 Input validation and sanitization
- ⚡ Production-grade rate limiting
- 🔄 Regular security updates
- 📝 Comprehensive logging and auditing
- 🎯 Content filtering and safety checks

## 🔄 Security Updates

We will:
- Review and address reported vulnerabilities
- Release security patches when needed
- Document fixes in release notes
- Notify users of critical issues
- Keep dependencies updated
