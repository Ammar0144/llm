## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ (Python 3.11+ recommended)
- pip or conda
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- Git

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm.git`
3. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
4. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
7. Make your changes and test thoroughly
8. Submit a pull request

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write clear, documented code with docstrings
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing
- Add tests for new functionality
- Test with different input scenarios
- Verify API endpoints work correctly
- Test security features (IP restrictions, etc.)
- Ensure Docker builds work correctly

### Documentation
- Update README.md for new features
- Document API changes in examples
- Include usage examples
- Document configuration options

## 🔒 Security Considerations

This project handles AI model inference and has security features:
- Always test IP access control functionality
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys
- Follow security best practices for FastAPI
- Test with different network configurations

## 🐛 Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports
